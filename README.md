# 📃 Folio

A simple hierarchical note-taking app.

🚧 Work in progress

## Usage
To run or build the app, you need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed. You also need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (or your preferred JavaScript runtime, I use [Bun](https://bun.sh/)).

Run `npm run tauri dev` (or your runtime's equivalent) to start the app in development mode.

Using the editor itself is relatively straightforward. You use the breadcrumb menu to navigate the hierarchy of notes. The editor itself is a [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/) headless editor.

## Planned
- Switch to pure markdown
- Move notes API to rust
- Search and indexing
- Locked notes
- Scripts

## Platform support
✅ MacOS\
⚠️ Windows (Works but not optimized, priority is MacOS for now)\
❓ Linux (Should work but not tested nor optimized)\
❌ iOS (Planned)\
❌ Android (Planned)
