A simple hierarchical note-taking app.

🚧 Work in progress

## Usage
To run or build the app, you need to have Rust installed. Follow the instructions on the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install Rust. You also need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (or your preferred JavaScript runtime, I use [Bun](https://bun.sh/)).

Run `npm run tauri dev` (or your runtime's equivalent) to start the app in development mode.

## Platform support
✅ MacOS\
⚠️ Windows (Works but not optimized, priority is MacOS for now)\
❓ Linux (Should work but not tested nor optimized)\
❌ iOS (Planned)\
❌ Android (Planned)
